# garr1son_hud
A HUD made by using the base trew_hud_ui. 
Decently optimised but it will be even better in the future. 
You can use the HUD wherever you want just dont take credit for it.
The part of the hud in the bottom left corner moves if you activate the map or if it isnt activated.
You can use the code to customise it for your liking.
